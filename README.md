# SFFoodFriends
## Helping to match shoppers and people in need

Thanks for your interest in SF Food Friends and in recreating our concept.

This website was creating using Flask and SQLite.

To host the webiste, you require a server or some kind of hosting service.
We are using "pythonanywhere" which provides a freemium hosting-as-a-service model, with the possibility to pay for a premium service to increase bandwidth and use your own domain.

You can find information about the matching algorithm in the customers.py file.

To recreate the website, simply clone the repository and change the names displayed in the html files as required.
Following this, upload the repository to a hosting service and connect it to the internet by following their directions.
